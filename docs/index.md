# MLDocs ðŸ“ƒ

MLDocs is a convenient, searchable, waffle-free, cheatsheet-like website which covers many foundational and more technically in-depth machine learning code and equations. In going through various online courses, books and technical docs, I quickly discovered the need for a resource to provide a handy reference to refer back to as and when needed.

Machine learning is a complex subject with many moving parts - it can be intimidating and easy to forget things sometimes!

Any algorithms and explanations given are intended to be as concise as possible. Where relevant, code examples and links to Google Colab notebooks will be provided. This is an ever-growing site and is actively maintained!

The accompanying GitHub repo behind this site is [ml-resources](https://github.com/harrybaines/ml-resources).
