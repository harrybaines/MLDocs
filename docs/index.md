## Machine Learning Algorithms

The algorithms and explanations listed here are intended to give a quick overview of how each algorithm works along with code examples to show how you can implement them. Library versions are provided along with the from-scratch implementations. Links to further resources are also given.

The following algorithms are available:

- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Random Forests
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM's)
- [ ] Naïve Bayes
- [ ] k-Nearest Neighbors
- [ ] k-means
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis
- [ ] Neural Networks

### Linear Regression

=== "From scratch version"

    ```python
    print("From scratch version")
    ```

=== "Library version"

    ```python
    print("Library version")
    ```
